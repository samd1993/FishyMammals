## Code and data files for Degregori et al. (in prog) "Coral reef fish gut microbiomes converge with mammals"
### This project analyzes the effects of host diet and host phylogeny on coral reef fish gut microbiomes and the possible convergence between fish and mammal gut microbiomes 

**R code folder** holds the shared ASVs analyses and differential abundance results. Actual figure codes are at bottom. First half of scripts are barplot and PCOA scripts that I ended up not using but keeping for now

**python folder** has all the Tree of Life scripts and results and alpha diversity plot script. The jupyter notebooks are under in the **files/scripts folder** and has the script to run the Mantel test and all the tree of life figure components. The script is mostly python and is able to import qiime2 files using QIIME2's API which is python based so it works very smoothly 

metadata is in the allmerged-metadata4.txt file
